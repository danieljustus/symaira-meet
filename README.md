`symmeet` is a local-first, standalone command-line tool for durable meeting
artifacts. It runs on macOS 15 or newer (Apple Silicon and Intel) and does not
require another Symaira binary, a cloud account, or telemetry.

> Current state: the first stable release ships local audio capture, transcription, model
> management, export formats, a menu-bar recording agent, and an MCP server.
> Meeting content stays on the device by default. Cloud transcription, accounts,
> automatic meeting detection, live captions, Intel Mac support, and encryption at
> rest are not included.

## Install

Build from source requires Swift 6.0+ and macOS 15 or newer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danieljustus/symaira-meet.git
cd symaira-meet
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/symmeet /usr/local/bin/
```

## Build

```bash
swift build
swift test
make lint
.build/debug/symmeet --help
```

The binary is named `symmeet`. Every `--json` command writes exactly one
snake_case JSON document to stdout; diagnostics stay on stderr.

### Tests and coverage

`swift test` (and `make test`) requires a **full Xcode installation** — the
Command Line Tools package does not include XCTest. On CLT-only machines the
Makefile fails fast and points at the canonical gate instead: CI runs the test
suite with coverage on every push and pull request and uploads
`coverage-report` (`coverage.lcov`) as a workflow artifact (GitHub Actions →
CI → run → Artifacts). With full Xcode, `make coverage` produces the same
`coverage.lcov` locally.

## CLI

```text
symmeet version [--json]
symmeet doctor [--json]
symmeet config path [--json]
symmeet meeting list [--json]
symmeet meeting show <meeting_id> [--json]
symmeet meeting trash <meeting_id> [--json]
symmeet meeting restore <meeting_id> [--json]
symmeet completion <bash|fish|zsh>
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` runtime failure, `2` invalid input or
configuration, `3` permission denied, and `4` unsupported operation. The
stable `version --json` handshake is:

```json
{"tool":"symmeet","version":"...","schema_version":1}
```

## Why symmeet

- Local-first: meeting content stays on the device by default.
- Standalone-first: artifacts are portable files, not records in a proprietary
  database.
- Contract-first: integrations use versioned, snake_case JSON at runtime.
- Privacy by design: future recording requires fresh, interactive authorization.
